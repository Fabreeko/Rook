Time to get started! 

first step is to get all of the heat sets placed.  If you are not familiar with this, Nero3D has a couple of good YouTube videos on it.

Start with the lower frame:

![Step1](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/ac8cb1ab-2427-40d4-b1e9-deb90d0f06e8)


Next Move on to the Bed Support

Now the upper frame

![IMG_0945](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/503c44c5-9dc0-46db-a3d9-452808ec70ff)


...and the tool head parts

![IMG_0946](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/a4ef54b3-33e8-4f30-85fe-decae257661b)

Next up is attaching the feet to the legs. An M5 nut is captured in the leg and an M5 SHCS attaches the foot.

![IMG_0947](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/01f12731-5023-4249-940e-ea3da25681cb)


Attach all fout feet to the lower frame as shown. 

![IMG_0948](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/866ceb6a-32cd-4668-9044-e205617f64af)


Stand it up, insert the 4 8mm rods into place. 

![IMG_0953](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/88638a28-65c9-48f6-9c29-1095ff2096da)

This is your firat "square and level check". On a known flat surface, make sure the feet don't wobble. flip it to stand upside down and check for wobbles.  this makes sure all the rods are insterted evenly. 

Grab the lower panel and the inserts. This should be a nice snug fit that can be tapped into place. Assemble all pieces. 


![IMG_0955](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/f4653d7a-c725-4ef4-98ea-43ab73e9f011)


Drop down over the rods. Pay atte tion to orientation here. 

![IMG_0954](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/a2d6c7e6-98ad-4457-8248-84f978aa8e5b)


Insert the Bearings in to the bed support and center them. They are extra long on purpose to provide more support. Attach the Z emdstop in place. 

![IMG_0956](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/da90a08e-81c1-499b-bff8-ad5152d4b642)

Lower the bed support onto the rear 8mm rods as shown. Note that the Z emdstop face down. 

![IMG_0957](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/20f56f12-3ac1-468a-9fe7-f37a9dc6e8f8)


Attach Y rails to the top frame. Leave the shuttle keepers in place for now. 

![IMG_0951](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/ccc64633-b06c-4294-935b-3a0cd30c6e39)


Place the top frame on too of the 8mm rods. Make sure it bottoms out on the rods. 

![IMG_0958](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/878a4ee0-0a65-4f05-817c-89a194e99c83)


Place motor mounts and front idlers on top frame. 
![IMG_0959](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/d99a324f-bc6f-404f-9a17-fb48b7716511)


Attach the linear rails to the X axis. Don't let the shuttle fall of the ends! 

![IMG_0961](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/a166939f-8148-4cfd-b01c-1cde7aa3a3bb)


Add the X axis to the shuttles. 

![IMG_0960](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/38104176-597e-4258-bc6e-3dc1e3980fb6)

Attach the motors to the motor mounts, adjusted all the way towards the front of the printer.  Wires go towards the center. Attach the GT2 pulleys as shown. Pay attention to orientation and height. 
![IMG_0966](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/0c402682-fca8-4f86-9c32-c2f2ac970fda)


This shows a proper bear stack assembly for a double bearing stack.  Note the two shims in the middle. Always do shim-bearing-bearing-shim on a single. a double is two singles so two shims in the middle. 
![IMG_0963](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/660140b9-a612-4d0e-a748-9cb25ba517f0)

Instal 4 simgle bearing stacks in the X axis. 

![IMG_0964](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/0dee16c5-1f56-4300-8029-b6c6ffe880d6)

![IMG_0965](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/f8d443ba-3c0e-4006-85e1-59f026c364cd)

...and a double bearing stack on each idler. 
![IMG_0967](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/76be85c5-bbfb-4f15-8b57-97c811e06880)

....and a single stack for the Z belt

![IMG_0998](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/9c9256b9-bec2-402a-9d33-c7f08331c0af)



The belt path is a standard CoreXY belt path. Study the two pics carefully. One is a cut away and the other is a normal view.  Being methodical here will pay off in the long run. 

![IMG_0971](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/539ab719-bbdf-4ab1-9f65-b173fa277d98)


![IMG_0970](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/16272b4e-b2f0-4010-b70d-91ee5ad0601a)

The first step will use the full length of the belt. With the teeth facing front, insert one end of the belt through the back of the mounting plate throught the top, right side yellow hole of the blue part in the picture. Fold the belt back over itself so about 25mm overlaps, teeth to teeth. Use a wire tie to temporarily secure it. (Note: my CAD skills and time did not allow me to show the belt loop or teeth so follow the words, not just the picture) 
![IMG_0969](https://github.com/FHOGPHIL/Rook_Fabreeko/assets/69829255/47f429df-d14d-4f19-bb7a-6af6817d3ee5)


Using tne picture above, route the other end through the top belt path all the way around and back through the top left hole from behind. Pull snug and temporarily secure the belt back onto itself. 

Carefully review your work while looking at the belt path in the picture. Make sure the belt is riding properly on each beating. 

Cut the belt aboit 25mm past the securing point. (So you have an extra 25mm). 

Now completely remove the belt.  

Lay the piece you just cut on top of the remaining belt and align the ends. The goal is to cut another piece the exact same length, down to the number of teeth.  Doing this right will make tuning easier later on.

Insert each belt through the back of the tool head mount (blue part) from the back on the same side, one top and one bottom. Fold each one back on itself, teeth to teeth, just enough to secure them together. (About 25mm). Do this identical for each one, down to the tooth. Secure each one to itself with two wire ties.

Loosely attach the tool head moint to the X rail.  Now reroute each belt according the the photos. Push the ends through the back of the tool head mount (might be easier to remove the mount from the tail for a minute) and pull tight. Ensure rhe same amount of teeth are exposed on each belt. When pulling, pull across the rail and not towards the front as that may break the part. Secure the belts back on to themselves and the mount to the rail.
